# Copy this file to .env and configure for your environment

# Database Configuration
# PostgreSQL connection string for job tracking and site progress
# Format: postgresql://user:password@host:port/database

# Redis Configuration
# Redis connection string for RQ task queue backend
# Format: redis://host:port/db
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

# Storage directory for site data (default: ../sites)
# This is where all site databases, text files, and PDFs are stored
STORAGE_DIR=../sites

# OCR Backend
# Choose OCR backend: 'tesseract' or 'vision' (macOS Apple Vision framework)
# Default: tesseract
#
# NOTE: Vision framework is significantly faster than Tesseract, but has a known
# issue with RQ workers on macOS: Apple's Objective-C runtime is not fork-safe,
# causing workers to crash with SIGABRT when Vision tries to initialize after fork().
#
# To use Vision, you would need to either:
# - Use a non-forking task queue architecture
# - Pre-initialize Vision before RQ forks (risky)
# - Disable fork safety checks (not recommended: OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES)
#
# For production stability, use tesseract until we implement a non-forking worker model.
DEFAULT_OCR_BACKEND=tesseract

# Worker Configuration
# Number of background workers for each queue type
# Used by scripts/install-workers.sh for LaunchAgent deployment
